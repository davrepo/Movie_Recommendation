# Movie Recommendation System and User Attribute Analysis - Network description
This  network represents 100,000 userâ€“movie ratings from http://movielens.umn.edu/. 

## Basic Network Description
The network is bipartite - left partition represents users of *movielens.org* site and right partition represents movies. 
An edge between a user and a movie represents the rating of the movie by that user. Edges are undirected and weighted - 
the weight of an edge represents the number of stars that the user gave to the movie. Edge weights are integers 
in the range 1-5 (where 1 is the worst rating and 5 is the best rating a movie can get)
